# ariel-os-hello

This is an [ariel-os](https://github.com/ariel-os) template project.
Just put it in the same directory as the ariel-os directory.

<pre>
./
  ariel-os/
    [ariel-os]
  ariel-os-hello/
    [this project]
</pre>

Then run `laze build -b <board> run` to flash the program to the connected board.
Replace `<board>` with the name of your board (eg. `espressif-esp32-c6-devkitc-1`).
